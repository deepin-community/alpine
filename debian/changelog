alpine (2.23+dfsg1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 2.23+dfsg1.
    - Security Bug: Alpine can be configured to start a secure connection using
      /tls on an insecure connection. However, if the connection is PREAUTH,
      Alpine will not upgrade the connection to a secure connection, because
      a client must not issue a STARTTLS to a server that supports it in
      authenticated state. This makes Alpine continue to use an insecure
      connection with the server, exposing user data. Reported by Damian
      Poddebniak and Fabian Ising from Münster University of Applied Sciences.
      Closes: #963179, CVE-2020-14929

      file encryption key. This allows users to use their password file without

      Closes: #934439
    - Remap UBOGON from 0xfffd to 0xfff8, since 0xfffd represents a missing
